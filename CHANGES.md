# Upcoming Changes - March 23

I cleaned up some of the result.py cli methods and fixed a few small
bugs.  CLI.md now summarizes the implemented cli operations.

Some folks asked about where this project is going with learning and
optimization.  Here's the end goal for the system as I see it now
(thanks to the folks that discussed this with me today!)

## The search space

The end goal is to search a space of potential agents for a task.  The
space is defined by a set of Interfaces, and potential Implementations
that can bd bound to these interfaces, as well as other options (like
`llm.model` which can be set for any individual implementation.)

**Status:** now we can specify any element in that space with a config
file.  We want to be able to specify the space itself as well, which
might look something like this:

```
ptools:
  analyze_sentence:
    method: [simulate, simulate_pydantic]
	llm.model: 
	 - together_ai/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.1
     - together_ai/openai/gpt-oss-20b
     - together_ai/Qwen/Qwen3.5-9B
  sport_for:
    method: [simulate, simulate_pydantic]
  ...
```

## Searching the space

We will add some methods for searching the space under
`src/secretagent/optimize`, presumably based on existing MODO
(multi-objective discrete optimization) packages.  These methods will
take a search space and find a set of Pareto-optimal configs.

To search the space, we need to evaluate a config with respect to
metrics we care about (for now, `correctness` and `cost`).  We can do
this now with CLI tools.

## Extending the space

We will build out the `src/secretagent/learn` package with other ways
of learning and combining implementations.  The first step will be to
run learning methods manually with CLI tools, and the next step will
be to implement some methods that look at the current Pareto-optimal
configs and suggest learning ops for specific implementations.

## Overview of the process

The final process should look like this.

 * Initialize the space with some interfaces and strategies, like
   ReAct and PoT
 * Using the training and validation sets:
   * **repeat** until convergence or budget is exhausted
     * search for Pareto-optimal configs
     * run one or more learning operations to expand the search space
 * Test the Pareto-optimal configs on the test set


# Changes - March 22

There is a very simple and barely-tested example of a learner now, in
the Makefile targets of `benchmarks/sports_understanding`.

To learn a new implementation of some interface `foo` you need to

 * Run an evaluation on the **training** split using some
implementation strategy that includes running some implementation of
`foo`, and the `evaluate.record_details=true` flag set.  This
generates distillation data for `foo` (i.e., input-output pairs).
Those results are filed in a directort specified by
`evaluate.result_dir` (in the Makefile `recordings`).

* Run a cli to do the learning.  That will collect the distillation
data into a working directory specified by --train-dir (in the
Makefile, `training`) and write the result of learning as a Python
function under `training/*foo__rote`.

* Configure `foo` with the learned implementation, by using
`foo.implement_via('learned',learner='rote',backoff=True)` or the
corresponding config options.  This will use rote learning to bypass
the original implementation and back off to the implementation used to
generate distillation data when the rote-learned function returns
None.

## Documentation and examples

In `benchmarks/sports_understanding` is an example of evaluating untrained
models for a simple task, with docs in `benchmarks/HOWTO.md`.


## LLM cost tracking 

New `costs` CLI tool with `extract_cached_stats` for analyzing LLM
spending from the cache
  - For example, running in benchmarks/sports_understanding: uv run python -m secretagent.cli.costs llm_cache
  generates this report:

```

## Analyzing results

Added filtering, `--most-recent` default, dotlist support, and config
comparison.
