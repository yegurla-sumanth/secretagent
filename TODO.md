# Tasks

## Core issues

 * non-primitive types don't work with Simulate
   * problem is output validation
   * should at least give warnings
   * when errors are caught by evaluator's, should _record relevant
     information from the stack trace
   * move expt.py into core

## In-context examples for simulate factory.

No easy way to do this - Jerry Yan on it

## Simplify expt.py

Assuming data splits in BENCHMARK/data/split.json as a serialized Dataset.

## CLI improvements

  * results.py validate [--require xxx] [--purge] ...
  * results.py delete-obsolete

## Caching

 * Check if disabling caching from the command-line works
 * Revisit how llm_util does caching - as is using the cache bypasses echos

## Experimentation

 * Run experiments in sports_understanding
     * use smaller models till the task gets "interesting"?

## Learning methods

Start with distilling react traces.

Add a src/secretagent/learn subdirectory

Add learn/baselines.py
  RoteLearner(prob_threshold)
   - report estimated coverage and accuracy
   - return the learned code as a loadable python function
 Test this on the zero-shot post process and `consistent_sports`

Add a learn/distill_pot.py
 * takes every pot function for every example
 * uses simulated interfaces to convert to a 'canonical' functional form
   "def workflow(...) -> ..."
 * uses ast to rename all the variables to v01, v02, ...
 * hashes them to get a smaller set of functions
 * computes coverage of each function (correct/incorrect)
 * does some sort of greedy set cover
 * incrementally calls a simulated interface to refactor the workflows
   into one program

## Code quality/etc

 * More guidance for claude/devs on defense programming
 * Standardize implement strategies: [un]structured_baseline, pot, workflow, react

## Known issues

 * Running the simulate_pydantic with tools leads to a bunch of
   litellm task warnings, which are meaningless but annoying and
   seemingly hard to fix.
