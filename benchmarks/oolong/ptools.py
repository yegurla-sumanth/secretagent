    Inputs:

    - entry_lines: list of data-entry lines (no headers/instructions)
    - label_set: allowed canonical labels (e.g., ["correct", "incorrect"])

    Requirements:
    - Classify each entry line into exactly one label from label_set.
    - Preserve input order.
    - Output count MUST equal len(entry_lines), with no omissions.
    - Output one record per input line.
    - idx must be batch_start_idx + line_position for every record.
    - Every idx in [batch_start_idx, batch_start_idx + len(entry_lines) - 1] must appear exactly once.
    - Do not skip, merge, duplicate, or invent records.
    - label must be lowercase and one of label_set.

    """
    Answer the question using only the provided classified records.

    Inputs:
    - question: The natural-language query to answer.
    - label_set: The allowed canonical labels for entries in this context.
    - records: A list of classified data entries. Each item has:
      - idx: integer index (order in context)
      - date: date string for the entry (e.g., "May 30, 2023"), or null if unavailable
      - user_id: integer user id, or null if unavailable
      - label: one canonical label assigned to that entry

    Important:
    - Each record corresponds to exactly one entry_text and exactly one label.
    - Each record.label must be one of label_set.
    - Use only information in question, records, label_set, and schema_metadata.
    - Do not use external knowledge or assumptions.
    - Respect record order when order matters for the question.

    Task:
    - Reason over the records (and labels) to compute the exact answer.
    - Follow question-specific formatting instructions if present.
  
    Code-execution constraints:
    - Do NOT use any `import ...` statements.
    - Do NOT use `sum(...)` (and avoid other built-in aggregators like `map`, `filter`).
    - Prefer explicit `for` loops and integer counters.
    - Avoid clever one-liners; write straightforward step-by-step code.

    Implementation hint (when the question asks for "most common" label):
    - Compute label frequencies by looping over `records`.
    - For each label in `label_set`, maintain a separate integer count.
    - Choose the label with the largest count.
    - If there is a tie, choose label_set[0].

    Output format rules:
    - ANSWER_TYPE.LABEL       -> "Label: <label>"
    - ANSWER_TYPE.NUMERIC     -> "Answer: <integer>"
    - ANSWER_TYPE.USER        -> "User: <integer>"
    - ANSWER_TYPE.DATE        -> "Date: YYYY-MM-DD" (or parseable date string)
    - ANSWER_TYPE.MONTH_YEAR  -> "Answer: <Month YYYY>"
    - ANSWER_TYPE.COMPARISON  -> "Answer: <more common than|less common than|same frequency as>"

    {
      "result": {
        "final_answer": "<formatted answer string>"
